# COFFEE-SHOP-SALES
## This is an Excel project I've created in which I picked a coffee shop sales data cleaned the data and then created a dashboard using that data and bring out all the necessary analysed data which can help the shop to analyse all the trends like from best time (when sales occur the most) to best product categories (product with the highest demand) product.
## Clean data using the power Query function
## Create pivot table
## Create an interactive dashboard with a slicer to see specific data for a particular time point
